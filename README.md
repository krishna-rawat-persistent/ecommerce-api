# e-Commerce API 

This is the REST API for e-Commerce, and it is based on Java / Maven / Spring Boot (version 2.7.12) with PostgreSQL as database support. 

## How to Run

This application is packaged as a jar which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.11 and Maven 3.x
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
        java -jar target/ecommerce_api-0.0.1.jar
or
        mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```
2023-06-05 13:55:54.851  INFO 15504 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8090 (http) with context path ''
2023-06-05 13:55:55.291  INFO 15504 --- [           main] c.w.ecommerce.EcommerceApiApplication    : Started EcommerceApiApplication in 8.488 seconds (JVM running for 8.993)
```

## About the Service

The service is an e-Commerce REST service. It uses PostgreSQL database to store the data. you can call some REST endpoints defined in ```com.workflow2.ecommerce.ProductController``` on **port 8090**. (see below)

You can use this REST app to perform end-to-end ecommerce operations like login-register, get Products, add to cart etc.

Here is what this little application demonstrates:

* Full integration with the latest **Spring** Framework: inversion of control, dependency injection, etc.
* Packaging as a single jar with embedded container (tomcat 8): No need to install a container separately on the host just run using the ``java -jar`` command
* Writing a RESTful service using annotation: supports both XML and JSON request / response; simply use desired ``Accept`` header in your request
* Exception mapping from application exceptions to the right HTTP response with exception details in the body
* *Spring Data* Integration with JPA/Hibernate with just a few lines of configuration and familiar annotations.
* All APIs are "self-documented" by Swagger3 using annotations

# Running the project with PostgreSQL

This project uses PostgreSQL database where we are using db known as ```ecommercedb``` 

Here is what you would do to back the services with PostgreSQL, for example:

### In pom.xml add:

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
        <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
```

### Append this to the end of application.properties:

```
---

    #Database configurations
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://{Your Host}:5432/ecommercedb
    spring.datasource.username=<Your Postgres Username>
    spring.datasource.password=<Your Postgres Password>

```
